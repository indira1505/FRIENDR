    Friendr is a simple web application that simulates a basic social media 
network. It's built using Angular for the frontend and MongoDB for storing 
user data like profiles and posts. Throughout the development, Postman was used 
to test the APIs and ensure everything works smoothly between the frontend and
backend. The app is an early-stage project designed to show how these 
technologies can work together to create a basic social network experience.
